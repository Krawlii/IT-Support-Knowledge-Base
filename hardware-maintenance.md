# Hardware Maintenance Guide

## 1. Regular Cleaning

**Steps to Follow**:
1. **Clean the Exterior**:
   - Use a microfiber cloth to wipe down the exterior of your PC, monitor, and peripherals.
   - Avoid using harsh chemicals. A damp cloth with water is sufficient.

2. **Clean the Interior**:
   - Power off the computer and unplug all cables.
   - Open the case and use compressed air to remove dust from components, especially the **CPU**, **GPU**, **fans**, and **power supply**.

3. **Monitor Fan Performance**:
   - Ensure all fans are working properly. If a fan is making noise or not spinning, replace it.
