### Wireless Connection (Wi-Fi):
1. **Set up Wi-Fi on the Router**:
   - Log into the router’s admin page (usually something like `192.168.1.1`).
   - Set up your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.

2. **Connect Devices**:
   - On each device, search for the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and enter the password to connect.
